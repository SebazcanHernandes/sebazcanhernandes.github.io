      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of troubling heads, you know you need an escape. This song may or may be the way out, but just know that Sebastian cares. He will reach out.</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the COVID-19 pandemic, Sebastian suffered severe depression and was lost in life momentarily. Music changed everything for him and became the sole reason he remained standing where he is today. As usual, Sebastian formed the instrumental first before the lyrics, creating the iconic riff in honor of his OPM roots. The topic of mental illness only came around when Sebastian finalized every other song off <i>Memories From My Own Dreams</i> as a message to listeners that maybe they'll be saved the way he was.</i></p>
