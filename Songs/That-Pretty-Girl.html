    <h1>That Pretty Girl</h1>
    <div id="about">
      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitment to romance can give you the biggest feelings. All those pent up emotions? Release them. Show yourself. What does it mean to be fond of someone?</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguably Sebastian's cheesiest song, the hard rock track delves deep into commitment and promise. As the name suggests, the song narrates Sebastian's true feelings for a crush he once had, even going as far as to accept the terms that they wouldn't work out to begin with. Accompanied by contrasting guitars and an organ, this was one of Sebastian's earlier takes on complex songwriting.</p>
