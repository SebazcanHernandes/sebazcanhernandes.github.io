      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straying to more songwriting, Sebastian tries his hand to "progressive" music with a tribute!</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian considers this composition to be his favorite off the <a href="https://twitch.tv/">Cerber</a>-dedicated EP. This was the first piece to introduce elements of progressive rock, with changes in time signature and tempo, though it did not reach the complexity normally found in progressive music. It also introduces beatbox percussion into the discography, which mainly came about when Sebastian didn't bother getting his software to play a drum track and instead used his mouth to make a beat. Even with the odd progression, he managed to keep the rockabilly spirit in the song.</p>
