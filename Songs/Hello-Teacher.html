    <div id="about">
      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first song by Sub to be completed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple guitar song, "Hello, Teacher" embraces simple music. Nothing much to say here other than its significance in Sub's songwriting journey.</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While still in the early stages of learning guitar, Sub discovered the simple chord progression which only made its way into a song in mid-2022. He only had his guitar back then, so the master version of the song only requires a guitar and vocals. The song was written and first performed for a Teachers' Day party in 2022.</p>
