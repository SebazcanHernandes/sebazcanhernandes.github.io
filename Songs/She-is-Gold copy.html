    <h1>She is Gold</h1>
    <div id="about">
      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another song of appreciation. Sub sings out to the devilish hellhound about why she's a great individual.</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was apparent that Sebastian has not been that active in the field of music around 2025. This explains his recent simplicity in songwriting, not putting much emphasis in more technical riffs. All this song was was a single take of him and his guitar, playing a string of chords that mesh enough to explore minor keys. The song is dedicated to <a href="https://twitch.tv/cerbervt/">CerberVT</a>, much like the rest of the EP where this song originates from. References include the mention of hellhound and Cerber's wholesomeness.</p>
