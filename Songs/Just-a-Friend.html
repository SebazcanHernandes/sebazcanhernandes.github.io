      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jazz? Sure thing! Sub is here to help with his expertise in going nuts. Oh wait, you want a chill song? You've come to the right place then as "Just a Friend" talks yet more on love.</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub is no stranger to jazz. It's one of his favorite genres, and admittedly, he composed this song as a way to bring out his passion for music further. The lyrics were written shortly after losing sight for romance. This song remains his most passionate composition off the eponymous debut alongside "Again Someday" and "Peace and Quiet".</p>
