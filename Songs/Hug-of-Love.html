    <h1>Hug of Love</h1>
    <div id="about">
      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A first attempt at a serenade, "Hug of Love" is your typical love song. As one of his first songs, Sub made use of basic chords when he first started out, which resulted in the song we know of today.</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written in late 2022, this song was derived from basic chord progressions. As the lyrics came along the same time as the melody, this song is one of the instances where no part of the songwriting process came first. This song was written in inspiration of his first few crushes.</p>
