  <body>
    <h1>Welcome Home</h1>
    <div id="about">
      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it simply, an odd song. Serving mainly as an album filler but a dive into other styles, "Welcome Home" brings in the complexities of Sebastian's mental state at the time without being direct about it.</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be obvious that Sub's main influence in this song has to do with grunge (specifically Nirvana) with its dirty sound and complex lyrics. Sub wanted a knack on this and composed this song without much thought into it. Most of the lyrics delve into mental illness as Sub was going through a rough time assesing his life. The song originally was going to use a D to Dm progression before it turned into a grunge song.</p>
