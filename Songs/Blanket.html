      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said to me... to relax, slow down, and get rest. Let "Blanket" sink you in to the dreams that even Sebastian wishes for you to appreciate.</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blanket" is known to be Sebastian's first original song that doesn't involve influence from existing songs. This track is considered as the first chord progression he ever wrote for himself, often avoiding the root key chord in the chorus. This is also Sebastian's first use of artificial female vocals where he modified his own vocal takes to recreate vocals a female may provide.</p>
