      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last song written for the album. Speaking about life and the world in general, Sub wanted to spread the message that anything can happen no matter what. While the song has a complicated tone in it, it represents the highest of opttimism in the entire record.</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sebastian</i> was originally going to be a 12-track album with "Peace and Quiet" going to "Fly High" but Sub wanted to treat the album into two sides, so when he learned that side one was too short, he decided to write "It Is What It Is" for a few hours. In the end, it serves as a closer for the album's side one with "Fly High" going to side two. The composition was written around the same time as "Blanket" as an experiment of using other chord progressions. This remains as one of Sub's least favorite compositions stating, "...most of the song felt iffy after production and I could've done more, but hey, it is what it is."</p>
