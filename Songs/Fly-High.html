      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A song to remember the ones we lost in our lives along the way.</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fly High" was written in memory of one of Sebastian's classmates who unexpectedly passed away days after his junior high graduation. The strange part about this song was that it was never intended for them until the sudden death. Sub came up with the title long ago but never wrote lyrics, only coming up with the idea of the loss of life to be adapted into the song. In the end, he decided to honor the fallen student by writing lyrics that may or may not be related to his relationship with them.</p>
