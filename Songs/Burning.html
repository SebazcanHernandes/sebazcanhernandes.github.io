      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want more terrible love songs by Sub? Here you go: one of Sebastian's first takes on heavier music apart from "Welcome Home".</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub's heavy interest in rock led to his delving into harsher genres such as heavy metal, although it was evident at some point that his voice wasn't built for it. "Burning" was another love song written by Sub which unlike his other love songs, this one wasn't written with his heart but as an album filler. It was mainly developed through the simple riff of the track and is now considered among his least favorite tracks off his discography.</p>
