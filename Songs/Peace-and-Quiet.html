      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song that started it all.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Sub's first songs, "Peace and Quiet" revolves around the noise of society that one wishes to stay away from. Most of the lyrics involve the main character finding themselves in situations that leaves them annoyed and/or disturbed. Using the classic rock and roll setup (guitars, bass, drums), Sub was able to create a catchy beat reminiscent of the 1950's and 1960's.</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written in early 2023, this was Sub's first attempt at a rock and roll song, as while he had the potential to write songs, he wasn't confident enough yet where his biggest priorities were song covers. During the songwriting process, he envisioned one's daily life for a sense of relatability.</p>
