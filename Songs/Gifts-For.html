      <h2>Song Bio:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a story for everyone to hear: one of sharing and happiness. Let Hernandez narrate a tale of gifts.</p>
      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This song serves as the main reason the holiday EP even exists. Unlike previous songs written by Sebastian, the story is based on a suggestion by his father as early as August of that year. It took 2 months for Sebastian to perfect the song for recording alone. The basic premise of the story involves a family of three: a father, his son, and his father (the son's grandfather). The plot features the three men getting gifts for an orphanage, believing that the best gift is bliss from kindness, with the intended lesson about sharing. Sebastian himself isn't aligned to religious practices despite his Catholic background, but he did believe that the essence of the late holiday spirit is about sharing a good time. This song was also the first to use key changes with Sub playing around with chords and rhythm structures.</p>
